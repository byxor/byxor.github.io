Programmers spend a **substantial amount of time typing**. Lots of it comes from writing code, _and presumably documentation... ahem_, but another source of that typing comes from **entering commands** into our terminals.

The (subjective) lack of an intuitive editing experience provided by many terminals can often make it frustrating to manipulate and edit commands, but don't fret; many terminal emulators **come with keyboard shortcuts** to help us out.

### Hotkeys:

```
Ctrl-b: Go back 1 character.
Ctrl-f: Go forward 1 character.
 Alt-b: Go back 1 word.
 Alt-f: Go forward 1 word.

Ctrl-a: Go to beginning of line.
Ctrl-e: Go to end of line.
  
Ctrl-d: Delete 1 character to the right of the cursor.
 Alt-d: Delete the rest of the word to the right of the cursor.
Ctrl-k: Delete everything to the right of the cursor.
Ctrl-w: Delete everything to the left of the cursor.

Ctrl-y: Paste the deleted text ^

Ctrl-p: Go to the previous command in history.
Ctrl-n: Go to the next command in history.
 Esc <: Go to first command in history.
 Esc >: Go to last command in history.
```

If you're a regular emacs user, you'll _(literally)_ be **uncomfortably familiar** with these hotkeys. In fact, I stumbled across them by accident through my emacs muscle memory.

### Known working terminals:

For the record, I've used these hotkeys on...
* `gnome-terminal` on Debian
* `termite` on Debian
* `iTerm2` on OSX (Although I had to tweak some miscellaneous settings to make the Option/Alt key work as expected)

### Now you either:

* **A)** Despise emacs.
* **B)** Enjoy the command-editing experience slightly more than you used to
* **C)** All of the above.

Until I write something more substantial, have a good one!
